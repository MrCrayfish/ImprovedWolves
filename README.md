# Improved Wolves

This is a simple mod which aims to improved wolves in Minecraft. Wolves will now automatically heal themselves by eating food from a dog bowl. You can press U to command your wolf to put your currently held item into the chest you are looking at. This mod is very basic for now but may be added onto in the future!
